## Project Overview
This project is part of my Front-End Development coursework, where I developed an online store called Rainy Days, specializing in jackets. The project involved setting up a headless WordPress instance with WooCommerce to manage products. The front-end site dynamically fetches product data using the WordPress REST API and displays it in a grid format, with a detailed view for each item. This approach allows product data to be updated and displayed without hardcoding it into the HTML, leveraging JavaScript for dynamic content.

## Features
- **Dynamic product management**: Products are fetched via the WordPress REST API from WooCommerce.
- **Product grid view**: A responsive grid displays available jackets with images and prices.
- **Product detail page**: Each product has its own detail page with more information.
- **JavaScript functionality**: All product data is fetched using JavaScript, allowing for smooth updates.
- **Mobile responsive design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for an optimal user experience.
- **Deployed online**: The site is hosted using a static host, ensuring fast load times.

## Technologies Used
- **WordPress** (headless setup)
- **WooCommerce** (product management)
- **JavaScript** (API fetching and rendering)
- **HTML5/CSS3** (front-end structure and styling)
- **Netlify** (for deployment)

## API Integration
This project utilizes the WordPress REST API to manage product data.

Fetching all products: JavaScript is used to fetch an array of product data from the WooCommerce API and render them on the homepage as thumbnails.
Product detail page: Individual product data is fetched based on an id search parameter and displayed on the product detail page.
Deployment
The website is deployed on Netlify.
