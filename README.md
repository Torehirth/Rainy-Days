# Rainy Days | Online Store for Jackets

This project is part of my front-end development coursework, where I developed an online store called **Rainy Days** for jackets. The goal was to create a dynamic website that uses the WordPress REST API to manage and display products from WooCommerce. This allows the product data to be fetched dynamically using JavaScript, instead of hardcoding the products into the HTML.

## Project Overview
**Rainy Days** is an online store that specializes in selling jackets. This project involved setting up a headless WordPress instance with WooCommerce to manage the products. The front-end site fetches product data from the API and displays it dynamically in a grid format, with a detailed view for each product.

## API Integration
This project utilizes the WordPress REST API to manage product data.

Fetching all products: JavaScript is used to fetch an array of product data from the WooCommerce API and render them on the homepage as thumbnails.
Product detail page: Individual product data is fetched based on an id search parameter and displayed on the product detail page.
Deployment
The website is deployed on Netlify.
