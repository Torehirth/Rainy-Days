          <h1>rainy days - quality jackets since 1999.</h1>
          <p>
            For 23 years we have been producing high quality jackets. We
            constantly test out new sustainable materials and making
            improvements to our products. This has taken us where we are today -
            Helping others pushing their comfort zone!

        <h2>our story</h2>
        <p>
          It all started as an idea when me and a buddy of mine were on a skiing
          trip, both with expensive new jackets. After a week with bad weather
          and a couple of ski-hiking tours the jackets began to tear up, making
          them wet and uncomfortable. We couldn't buy new jackets because all of
          our money was wasted on the trip, and of course on the jackets.
          Therefor we had to endure the the remaining week beeing constantly wet
          and miserable!
        </p>
        <p>
          When we finaly got back home safely from the two week long trip both
          of us had come up with some brand new ideas for what functionality our
          jackets should have and what it should endure. keywords as quality,
          affordable and good looking was our criteria. We sat down and
          brainstormed a couple of ideas that we were happy with. It didn’t go
          long before we were in contact with garment suppliers and getting a
          brand new sewing machine. Back at the house we furnished the basement
          into our little “factory”.
        </p>
        <p>And this was the start of the brand Rainy Days.</p>
